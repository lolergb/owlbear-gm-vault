### Supported content

- **Notion pages** - Private or public pages (shared with your integration)
- **PDFs** - Any publicly accessible PDF file
- **External URLs** - Any web page (with optional CSS selectors)

### 💡 Tips

- **Each user has their own token:** Configure your token once and use it in all rooms
- **Each room is independent:** Pages are configured per room, but the token is shared
- **Private token:** Your token is stored locally in your browser, only you can see it
- **Notion URLs:** You can use private pages (they don't need to be public) if you share them with your integration
- **Icons:** Pages automatically show their Notion icon
- **Images:** Click on any image to view it at full size
- **Change token:** Click **🔑** → Delete Token to go back to using the server token (if configured)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Page doesn't open:**
- Verify that the Notion URL is correct
- Make sure the URL is complete (without `?source=...` parameters)
- Check that the page is shared with your integration

**External content doesn't load:**
- For PDFs: Make sure the URL is publicly accessible
- For external URLs: Some pages block iframes for security (CORS)
- Check the browser console for CORS or iframe errors

**Extension doesn't appear:**
- Verify that `manifest.json` is publicly accessible
- Check that the manifest URL is correct in Owlbear

**Token error:**
- Verify that your token is correct (starts with `secret_` or `ntn_`)
- Make sure the integration has access to the pages you're trying to view

**Cache issues:**
- Use the 🔄 button to reload a specific page
- Use the 🗑️ button to clear all cache
